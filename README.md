# NNs-playground

In this repository you can find source code in the form of `.ipynb` Python Notebooks that provide solutions to classic Machine Learning topics. The code was developed alongside with the Course [Neural Networks - Deep Learning](https://qa.auth.gr/en/x/class/1/600237255) the author attended during their 6th semester of studies at the [Computer Science Department of AUTh](https://www.csd.auth.gr/en/).

The repository will be dynamically updated throught the fall semester (Oct 2023 - Feb 2024) so as to - finally - include all code solutions of the assignment series. At the moment, the interested viewer can find source code in `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow` and `Keras` that covers the following NN topics:

1. Implementing a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for a multiclass image classification problem + comparing its performance over KNN classifier and Nearest Centroid Classifier.

(README will be updated on the fly as well)
